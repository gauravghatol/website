# Department Files Update Status

## ✅ Completed
- [x] Mechanical.jsx - Updated with full CSE structure

## 🔄 In Progress
The following files need to be updated with the CSE structure while keeping their banners:

### Electrical.jsx
- Banner: `electricalBanner` from `'../../assets/images/departments/electrical/Electrical Banner.png'`
- Title: "Electrical Engineering (Electronics & Power)"

### EnTC.jsx
- Banner: `electronicsBanner` from `'../../assets/images/departments/electronics/Electronics Banner.png'`
- Title: "Electronics & Telecommunication Engg."

### IT.jsx
- Banner: `itBanner` from `'../../assets/images/departments/it/IT banner.png'`
- Title: "Information Technology"

### MBA.jsx
- Banner: `mbaBanner` from `'../../assets/images/departments/mba/MBA banner.png'`
- Title: "Master of Business Administration (MBA)"

### AppliedSciences.jsx
- Banner: `ashBanner` from `'../../assets/images/departments/ash/ASH banner.png'`
- Title: "Applied Sciences and Humanities"

## Instructions
Each file should:
1. Import all React hooks and icons (same as CSE.jsx)
2. Have the complete sidebar navigation structure
3. Include all content tabs with proper state management
4. Use the exact same CSS classes and animations
5. Keep only their original banner import and variable
6. Have placeholder content that matches CSE structure
